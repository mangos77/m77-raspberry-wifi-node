# m77-raspberry-wifi-node

It is a module that I have developed in **node.js** to configure a **Raspberry Pi** Wifi network that uses **wpa_cli** from **wpa_supplicant**.

___
**Implementation of this module is now available to create a fully featured API for node.js with express.**

You can find it at [***api-m77-raspberry-wifi-node***](https://github.com/mangos77/api-m77-raspberry-wifi-node)

___

### Why do I do it?

Because I have benefited a lot from the work of other people and organizations that offer development modules and I want to give something back to the community.

I have dedicated several hours to try to give the necessary functionalities for a correct development of applications in node.js.

I hope you find it very useful and recommend it so that it reaches more developers :-)
## Install
```
npm install m77-raspberry-wifi-node
```

## Use
In order to initialize the module, it must first be imported, instantiated and initialized **(in an asynchronous function)** with the desired configuration
```
const M77RaspberryWIFI = require('m77-raspberry-wifi-node')
const wifi = new M77RaspberryWIFI()

async function start() {
    const init = await wifi.init()
}
start()
```

## Methods
*** **Important note: All methods are asynchronous**

### listInterfaces()
Auxiliary method to know which are the Wi-Fi interfaces of the system
```
const interfaces = await wifi.listInterfaces()
console.log(interfaces)
```
Response:
```
{
  success: true,
  msg: 'Wi-Fi interfaces found on the system',
  data: [ 'wlan0_ap', 'wlan0' ]
}
```
Error:
```
{ success: false, msg: `There are no Wi-Fi interfaces in the system.`, data: [] }
```

### init(options)
Initialize the interface and options to be able to use the other methods
options:
- *device* - The interface to use - default **wlan0**
- *debugLevel* - The debug level displayed on the console (0 - Nothing, 1 - Basic, 2 - Full) - Default **2**
- *scan_timeout* - Maximum waiting time in milliseconds to scan Wi-Fi networks - Default **15000**
- *connect_timeout* - Maximum waiting time in milliseconds to scan Wi-Fi networks - Default **45000**
```
const init = await wifi.init({ device: "wlan0", debugLevel: 0 })
console.log(init)
```

Response:
```
{ success: true, msg: 'Interface wlan0 has been found on the system' }
```

Error:
```
{ success: false, msg: `The wlan0 interface does not exist. Please execute the listInterfaces() method to get the list of available Wifi interfaces and set in init() method.` }
```

### status()

```
const status = await wifi.status()
console.log(status)

### connect(config)
Method that tries to establish a connection with a Wi-Fi network, this can be secure, hidden, open networks or combinations.
If the connection could not be made, it tries to connect to any of the Wi-Fi networks saved in the system that are available.
**This action can take a long time per connection attempt, the maximum timeout for each connection attempt is defined in init() with the *connect_timeout* configuration parameter **

config:
- *ssid* - Name of the Wi-Fi network to connect to
- *psk* - Wifi network password - **Leave empty in case of open network**
- *removeAllNetworks* - [true | false] If you want to delete all saved networks - Default **false**
- *hidden* - [true | false] To indicate whether or not it is a hidden network - By default **false**
- *bssid* - Use the bssid in case you want to fix the connection, *or in the case that the ssid uses two bands and you need to connect to a specific band* - By default '' (does not bind the connection to the bssid)

```
const connect = await wifi.connect({ ssid: "mangos77_other", psk: "sd343dsdsss"})
console.log(connect)
```
Response:
***Connection could be established***
```
{
  success: true,
  msg: 'The Wi-Fi network has been successfully configured on interface wlan0',
  data: {
    milliseconds: 24851,
    connected_to: { milliseconds: 24851, ssid: 'mangos77_other' }
  }
}
```
***Could not establish connection***
```
{
  success: false,
  msg: 'Could not connect to SSID "mangos77_other" on interface wlan0. The interface wlan0 has been reconnected to ssid "mangos77" in 6315 milliseconds',
  data: {
    milliseconds: 59481,
    connected_to: { milliseconds: 6315, ssid: 'mangos77' }
  }
}
```

### disconnect()
Method to disconnect the current Wifi from the interface
```
const disconnect = await wifi.disconnect()
console.log(disconnect)
```
Response:
```
{ success: true, msg: 'Interface wlan0 has been disconnected' }
```

### reconnect()
Try to re-connect to a network saved in the system
```
const reconnect = await wifi.reconnect()
console.log(reconnect)
```
Response: 
```
{
  success: true,
  msg: 'The interface wlan0 has been reconnected to ssid "mangos77" in 13487 milliseconds',
  data: { milliseconds: 13487, ssid: 'mangos77' }
}
```

Error:
```
{ success: false, msg: 'Failed to reconnect interface wlan0' }
```
